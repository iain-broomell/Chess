# Iain Broomell's Chess Engine
#### Hi, I'm Iain Broomell, and this is my chess engine.
The entire point of this chess engine is to provide a medium through which I can learn and apply new skills in the C++ language. I knew very little at the start of this project, and being stuck in tutorial hell as I was, there was no hope. So far I've managed to only use Stack Overflow and ChatGPT for the purpose of figuring out WHY errors and bugs are happening, not for the purpose of solving the actual problem. Problem solving has been a big issue for me as a practically infantile developer (stuck in tutorial hell as I was), so this project is the perfect exercise for me. 

#### Why not Python?
I don't like Python. I need to learn about programming in general without the use of tons of abstractions.

#### Why not C?
I made checkers in C already, as horrible as it was, and want to use the abstractions of C++ over C because I'm too lazy to work on that yet. Maybe a future project will involve building some of those systems from the ground up, like the true chad developers of old.
